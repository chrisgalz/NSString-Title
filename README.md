NSString-Title
==============

This is for one of my apps that has to use this old API that only returns all caps data.

If you have a string like "MY GREAT ORGANIZATION OF THE STUFF," it turns it into "My Great Organization of the Stuff."

Just import the header, and you get a string like this [NSString titleStringFromString:myString];
